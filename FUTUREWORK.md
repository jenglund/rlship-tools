# Future Work and Implementation Plans

This document outlines the roadmap for future development of the Tribe project, including planned features, implementation details, and testing strategies.

## User Story Implementation Plans

### User Story #1: Basic Authentication and Tribe Viewing Flow

**Implementation Plan**:
   
**Frontend Changes**:
- Create a SplashScreen component
- Create a LoginScreen component with dev user login buttons
- Create a TribesScreen component to list user's tribes
- Create a TribeDetailsScreen component to show tribe members
- Implement navigation between these screens
- Add authentication state management
- Create comprehensive tests for each component and the full flow

**Backend Support Needed**:
- Endpoints for user authentication (using dev users initially)
- Endpoints to retrieve user's tribes
- Endpoints to retrieve tribe members

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Authentication will initially use dev users, but will eventually support Google login
- UI should be optimized for quick loading, especially the splash screen
- For now, data can be mocked locally while we implement the API integration

## Backend Development Priorities

1. **Enhance Database Operations**
   - Add transaction boundaries for multi-step operations
   - Improve error handling and reporting
   - Add database constraints (unique tribe names, etc.)

2. **API Enhancements**
   - Implement comprehensive request validation
   - Add consistent error handling patterns
   - Improve API documentation
   - **NEW**: Add endpoints to support the authentication and tribe viewing flow

3. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Fix skipped tests in List Repository
   - Increase service layer test coverage (currently at 78.6%)
   - Add tests for sync-related models (currently 0% coverage)

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement per-tribe display names
   - Enhance list synchronization with external sources (Google Maps)
   - Support for advanced interest indicators and scheduling

## Frontend Development Priorities

1. **Implement Authentication and Tribe Viewing Flow**
   - Create splash screen and login screens
   - Implement tribe listing and viewing screens
   - Add navigation between screens
   - Set up authentication state management

2. **API Integration**
   - Implement service layer to interact with backend API
   - Add authentication flow (Google account integration)
   - Set up proper state management

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Enhance mobile-first design
   - Add responsive layouts for desktop testing
   - Implement proper navigation and transitions

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Increase test coverage to at least 80%
   - Add integration tests with mock API
   - Implement E2E testing

5. **Feature Implementation**
   - Create and manage tribes
   - Share lists with tribes
   - Interest button functionality
   - Activity scheduling and tracking

6. **Production Readiness**
   - Error handling and offline support
   - Performance optimization
   - Analytics and monitoring

## Mobile App Development with Expo 50

Now that we have our mobile app running with Expo 50, here's our plan for future enhancements:

1. **Package Version Optimization**
   - Update packages to the recommended versions shown in Expo warnings:
     - `@expo/vector-icons`: Upgrade to ^14.0.0
     - `expo-device`: Upgrade to ~5.9.4
     - `expo-image-picker`: Upgrade to ~14.7.1
     - `expo-notifications`: Upgrade to ~0.27.8
     - `expo-status-bar`: Upgrade to ~1.11.1
     - `react-native`: Upgrade to 0.73.6
     - `react-native-safe-area-context`: Upgrade to 4.8.2
     - `react-native-screens`: Upgrade to ~3.29.0
     - `babel-preset-expo`: Upgrade to ^10.0.0
   - Fix TypeScript errors in navigation components

2. **Performance Improvements**
   - Implement code splitting to reduce initial load time
   - Add proper asset caching and preloading
   - Optimize images and other assets for mobile usage
   - Monitor and minimize re-renders using React DevTools

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add unit tests for core components and screens
   - Set up end-to-end testing with Detox
   - Implement component testing with React Native Testing Library
   - Add CI/CD support for mobile testing

4. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Add customized tab bar with appropriate icons
   - Implement smooth transitions between screens
   - Add skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
   - Support dark mode through a theme provider

5. **Offline Support**
   - Implement data persistence with AsyncStorage
   - Add proper handling of network state changes
   - Create optimistic UI updates for faster feedback
   - Implement background data synchronization

6. **Development Experience**
   - Add proper type definitions for all components
   - Create a storybook instance for component visualization
   - Implement hot reloading optimization
   - Add ESLint and Prettier for code quality

7. **Future Expo Upgrade Path**
   - After stabilizing on Expo 50, explore upgrading to Expo 53 again
   - Research compatibility requirements for React 19
   - Create a test branch for experimental upgrades
   - Document upgrade process and gotchas

## Integration Testing Roadmap

To ensure that our frontend and backend work well together, we'll implement an integration testing plan:

1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Set up a consistent local environment for testing frontend with backend
   - Create test user accounts for development

2. **API Contract Testing**
   - Implement API contract tests to ensure frontend and backend agree on endpoints
   - Use tools like Pact for consumer-driven contract testing

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Test tribe creation, list sharing, and activity management

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Add integration tests to CI/CD workflow
   - Ensure both frontend and backend changes are tested together
