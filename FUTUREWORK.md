# Future Work and Implementation Plans

This document outlines the roadmap for future development of the Tribe project, including planned features, implementation details, and testing strategies.

## User Story Implementation Plans

### User Story #1: Basic Authentication and Tribe Viewing Flow

**Implementation Plan**:
   
**Frontend Changes**:
- Create a SplashScreen component
- Create a LoginScreen component with dev user login buttons
- Create a TribesScreen component to list user's tribes
- Create a TribeDetailsScreen component to show tribe members
- Implement navigation between these screens
- Add authentication state management
- Create comprehensive tests for each component and the full flow

**Backend Support Needed**:
- Endpoints for user authentication (using dev users initially)
- Endpoints to retrieve user's tribes
- Endpoints to retrieve tribe members

**Technical Implementation Details**:
- Authentication will initially use dev users, but will eventually support Google login
- UI should be optimized for quick loading, especially the splash screen
- For now, data can be mocked locally while we implement the API integration

## Backend Development Priorities

1. **Enhance Database Operations**
   - Add transaction boundaries for multi-step operations
   - Improve error handling and reporting
   - Add database constraints (unique tribe names, etc.)

2. **API Enhancements**
   - Implement comprehensive request validation
   - Add consistent error handling patterns
   - Improve API documentation
   - **NEW**: Add endpoints to support the authentication and tribe viewing flow

3. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Fix skipped tests in List Repository
   - Increase service layer test coverage (currently at 78.6%)
   - Add tests for sync-related models (currently 0% coverage)

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement per-tribe display names
   - Enhance list synchronization with external sources (Google Maps)
   - Support for advanced interest indicators and scheduling

## Frontend Development Priorities

1. **Implement Authentication and Tribe Viewing Flow**
   - Create splash screen and login screens
   - Implement tribe listing and viewing screens
   - Add navigation between screens
   - Set up authentication state management

2. **API Integration**
   - Implement service layer to interact with backend API
   - Add authentication flow (Google account integration)
   - Set up proper state management

3. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Enhance web-first design with responsive layouts
   - Implement proper navigation and transitions
   - Support both desktop and mobile viewing experiences

4. **Test Coverage**
   - Increase test coverage to at least 80%
   - Add integration tests with mock API
   - Implement E2E testing

5. **Feature Implementation**
   - Create and manage tribes
   - Share lists with tribes
   - Interest button functionality
   - Activity scheduling and tracking

6. **Production Readiness**
   - Error handling and offline support
   - Performance optimization
   - Analytics and monitoring

## React 19 Web Application Development

Now that we're building a React 19-based web application, here's our plan for future enhancements:

1. **Modern React Architecture**
   - Utilize React 19's latest features and patterns
   - Implement a component-driven architecture
   - Use hooks for state management
   - Create reusable UI components

2. **State Management**
   - Consider context API for simpler state management
   - Evaluate Redux Toolkit for more complex state requirements
   - Implement optimized state updates

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use React's built-in performance optimization techniques
   - Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
   - Add proper asset caching and optimize bundle size
   - Utilize React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback appropriately

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add unit tests for core components using React Testing Library
   - Implement component testing
   - Set up end-to-end testing with Cypress
   - Add CI/CD support for automated testing

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**
   - Implement a modern, responsive design system
   - Create smooth transitions between routes
   - Add skeleton loading states for better perceived performance
   - Support dark mode through a theme provider

6. **Offline Support**
   - Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
   - Add service workers for offline access
   - Use localStorage/IndexedDB for data persistence
   - Implement optimistic UI updates for faster feedback

7. **Development Experience**
   - Add proper TypeScript type definitions for all components
   - Create a Storybook instance for component development and documentation
   - Implement ESLint and Prettier for code quality
   - Add comprehensive documentation

## Integration Testing Roadmap

To ensure that our frontend and backend work well together, we'll implement an integration testing plan:

1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Set up a consistent local environment for testing frontend with backend
   - Create test user accounts for development

2. **API Contract Testing**
   - Implement API contract tests to ensure frontend and backend agree on endpoints
   - Use tools like Pact for consumer-driven contract testing

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Implement E2E tests for critical user flows
   - Test tribe creation, list sharing, and activity management

4. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
   - Add integration tests to CI/CD workflow
   - Ensure both frontend and backend changes are tested together
