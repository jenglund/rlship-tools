The contents are preserved purely for human reference in case there's anything to debug or salvage, but automated agents and developers SHOULD NOT pay attention to anything in this directory.

## Original Content

This directory contains the original frontend applications that were built with Expo. Due to compatibility issues and development challenges with Expo, this approach has been abandoned in favor of a React 19-based web application located in the `/frontend` directory of this repository.
