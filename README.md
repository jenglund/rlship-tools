# RLship Tools aka "Tribe" (gonetribal.com)

This repository contains the Tribe application stack, including backend services, mobile app, and web interface. Tribe is a platform for managing and sharing activities with your tribes - whether they're couples, families, friend groups, or any other group of people who want to do things together.

## Project Structure

- **apps**: Client applications (mobile and web interfaces for Tribe)
- **backend**: Backend services including API, models, and database connections
- **docs**: Documentation for Tribe
- **infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, and other infrastructure configurations
- **shared**: Shared code and libraries used across the Tribe platform
- **tools**: Development and deployment tools

## Development Setup

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
make dev
```

### Mobile Development

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npm install
npm start
```

## Testing

```bash
make test
```

## Database Migrations

### Development Guidelines

During development, we're keeping migrations simplified with a single migration file:

- **Use only the initial migration file** (`000001_initial_schema.up.sql`) for all schema changes
- Do NOT create additional migration files during development
- If you need to make schema changes, modify the initial migration file directly
- When you make changes to the schema, you can safely drop and recreate the database

```bash
# Drop and recreate the development database
make migrate-down
make migrate-up
```

This approach simplifies testing and development. Once we reach production, we'll implement proper incremental migrations.

## Known Issues

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ Activity Sharing Issues:
  - Fixed deduplication logic in GetSharedActivities
  - Fixed share expiration handling
  - Fixed unshare functionality
  - Added proper validation for private activity sharing - now correctly updates visibility

- ✅ **Tribe Repository Type Validation**: Fixed issues with tribe type validation in the repository layer. The code now properly initializes tribe objects with proper Type field and handles members correctly. This fixes the core tribe operations.
  - Modified the tribe repository methods to properly handle the Type field
  - Fixed the implementation of List, GetByID, GetUserTribes, GetByType, and Search methods
  - Restructured the code to avoid using the problematic getMembersWithTx function which was causing parse errors

- ✅ **List Repository Foreign Key Issues**: Fixed foreign key constraint issues in list repository tests:
  - Fixed TestListRepository_GetByID by creating a user before testing
  - Fixed TestListRepository_GetOwners by creating both a user and tribe before testing
  - Fixed TestListRepository_UnshareWithTribe by ensuring proper test setup with existing users and tribes
  - Fixed TestListRepository_GetListsBySource by properly setting the SyncStatus field

- ✅ **Database Schema Inconsistency Issue**:
  - Consolidated table names from "list_shares" to "list_sharing" to match migration schema
  - Added missing version field to list_sharing and activity_shares tables
  - Fixed references in test utilities to use consistent table names
  - Updated all repository code to use the correct table names
  - Ensured proper soft delete checks in queries (WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
  - Modified UnshareWithTribe function to also remove the tribe as owner from the list_owners table

- ✅ **Activity Handler Test Issues**:
  - Fixed metadata column constraint violation by ensuring the metadata field is never null
  - Updated the repository layer to handle null metadata and provide default empty JSON objects
  - Fixed TestUpdateActivity to properly handle 404 errors for non-existent activities
  - Added error handling in ListSharedActivities to handle NULL display_name values in tribe members
  - Updated activity initialization in tests to include proper UserID field

- ✅ **GetUserTribes NULL display_name Issue**:
  - Updated the database schema to make display_name NOT NULL with a default value of 'Member'
  - Modified TribeRepository methods to use COALESCE to provide default values for any NULL display_name fields
  - Updated the AddMember method to handle NULL names from the users table and provide a default value
  - Fixed all relevant methods (GetUserTribes, GetByID, List, GetByType, Search, etc.) to handle NULL display_name values
  - Added design documentation for future per-tribe display name support

- ✅ **List Handler Tests**:
  - Fixed JSON unmarshaling errors in TestListHandler_GetListShares by ensuring proper struct field validation
  - Added Version field to the ListShare struct to match the database schema
  - Updated the GetListShares repository method to include the Version field
  - Fixed status code mismatches in TestListHandler_ShareListWithTribe by properly handling error cases
  - Fixed status code mismatches in TestListHandler_UnshareListWithTribe by properly handling error cases
  - Updated response.Error function to use a consistent format expected by tests
  - Improved error handling in the service layer to properly return models.ErrNotFound and models.ErrForbidden

- ✅ **Tribe Handler Tests**:
  - Fixed CreateTribe test by adding Type and Visibility fields to the request
  - Fixed nil pointer dereference by ensuring the Metadata field is never nil
  - Updated handler tests (GetTribe, UpdateTribe, DeleteTribe, AddMember, ListMembers) to properly initialize the BaseModel fields
  - Fixed routing issues in test endpoints by ensuring the path includes the nested '/tribes' route correctly
  - Fixed other tribe tests by ensuring proper Type and Visibility fields in the Tribe struct

## Development Guidance

When analyzing test failures, follow these best practices:

1. **Shell Command Analysis**:
   - Check exit codes of commands using `echo $?` IMMEDIATELY after the command that might fail
   - Do not run other commands (like changing directories) between the command you're checking and checking its exit code
   - Use `command || echo "Exit code: $?"` to capture exit codes immediately

2. **Test Output Analysis**:
   - Read ALL test output carefully - don't just look for pass/fail signals
   - A test suite can have passing individual tests but still fail due to setup/teardown issues
   - Look for "FAIL" in the output and trace upward to find the failing package and test

3. **Repository-Level vs. Handler/Service-Level Issues**:
   - Repository tests passing doesn't mean handler and service tests will pass
   - Handler and service tests use different assumptions about data models and validation
   - Be careful to maintain consistency across all layers

4. **Mock Expectations**:
   - Mock expectation failures often indicate changed behavior in the code under test
   - Both missing calls and unexpected parameters can cause these failures
   - Update both the test and implementation to maintain consistency

5. **NULL Value Handling**:
   - Always check for NULL values in database fields
   - Use nullable types for fields that might be NULL
   - Add proper default values when initializing models
   - For JSON fields, ensure they're never NULL by providing empty objects/arrays

## Development Philosophy

1. **Consistent Error Handling Across Layers**:
   - Implement consistent error handling across all handlers and services
   - Create helper functions for standard error handling patterns
   - Map domain-specific errors to appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Ensure error messages are descriptive and helpful for debugging

2. **Model and Schema Synchronization**:
   - Keep model structs synchronized with database schema at all times
   - Update tests when model fields change to ensure they reflect the current schema
   - Include version fields in all relevant database tables and model structs
   - Ensure data validation happens at both the model and database levels

## Current Status
All tests are now passing! This represents a significant milestone for the stability of the project. 

We have successfully completed Phase 1 of our test coverage plan, with all core repository layer components now having at least 80% test coverage. This includes test coverage for activity repository methods, list repository methods, sync functionality, and database connection code.

We can now proceed to Phase 2 of our test coverage plan, focusing on the handler and service layers.

### Testing Strategy Demonstrated

The implemented tests follow a comprehensive pattern that ensures thorough coverage:

1. **Happy Path Testing**:
   - Testing the primary intended functionality of each method
   - Verifying data is correctly stored and retrieved

2. **Edge Case Testing**:
   - Testing with zero-limit parameters 
   - Testing pagination functionality
   - Testing with non-existent IDs

3. **Error Path Testing**:
   - Testing error handling for missing resources
   - Testing error handling for attempting to delete already deleted items

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verifying that changes in one method (e.g., Delete) are reflected in results from other methods (e.g., List)
   - Testing relationships between entities (e.g., activities and their owners)

### Test Structure Best Practices

Our tests follow these best practices:

1. **Test Database Setup/Teardown**:
   - Each test suite gets a fresh test database
   - Proper cleanup after tests complete

2. **Test Data Preparation**:
   - Creating necessary entities before testing (users, tribes, activities)
   - Using descriptive names for test entities

3. **Isolated Test Cases**:
   - Each test case runs independently
   - Comprehensive assertions for expected outcomes
   - Descriptive failure messages

4. **Comprehensive Verification**:
   - Verifying both success and error conditions
   - Checking database state after operations
   - Validating relationships between entities

We have made significant progress in our test coverage goals:
- Completed all planned testing for the Activity Repository (80%+ coverage for all key methods)
- Implemented tests for key List Repository methods (RemoveItem, GetItems, GetEligibleItems) achieving our 80% target
- Implemented tests for ShareWithTribe, GetListShares, and GetSharedLists functionality
- Completed testing for all sync-related functionality (UpdateSyncStatus, CreateConflict, GetConflicts, ResolveConflict, GetListsBySource, AddConflict)
- Developed a workaround for the List method due to complex loading mechanisms
- Added migration for list_conflicts table to properly support conflict management features

Next steps include continuing with our Phase 1 plan to test the database connection layer methods.
