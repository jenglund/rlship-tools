# Action Plan for List Management Frontend Implementation

## 1. Overview of List Management Components

The following components are needed to implement the list management functionality:

### New Components to Create:
1. **ListsListScreen** - Main screen showing all lists for the user and lists shared with their tribes
2. **ListDetailScreen** - View details of a single list and its items
3. **ListItemDetailScreen** - View/edit details of a single list item
4. **CreateListModal** - Modal for creating a new list
5. **EditListModal** - Modal for editing list properties
6. **CreateListItemModal** - Modal for adding a new item to a list
7. **EditListItemModal** - Modal for editing an item
8. **ShareListModal** - Modal for sharing a list with tribes
9. **ListSharesView** - Component showing which tribes a list is shared with

### New Services:
1. **listService.js** - Service for interacting with list-related API endpoints

## 2. Data Flow and State Management

The list management functionality will follow this data flow:

1. User can view their lists and lists shared with their tribes on the ListsListScreen
2. From there, they can create new lists, view existing lists, or manage list sharing
3. When viewing a list, users can add, edit, or remove items from the list
4. Users can share lists with tribes they are members of

## 3. Required API Integration Points

Here are the key API endpoints we'll need to implement in the frontend:

### List Management
- `GET /api/lists/user/{userID}` - Get all lists owned by the current user
- `GET /api/lists/shared/{tribeID}` - Get lists shared with tribes the user belongs to
- `POST /api/lists` - Create a new list
- `GET /api/lists/{listID}` - Get a specific list
- `PUT /api/lists/{listID}` - Update a list
- `DELETE /api/lists/{listID}` - Delete a list

### List Items Management
- `GET /api/lists/{listID}/items` - Get all items in a list
- `POST /api/lists/{listID}/items` - Add an item to a list
- `PUT /api/lists/{listID}/items/{itemID}` - Update a list item
- `DELETE /api/lists/{listID}/items/{itemID}` - Remove an item from a list

### List Sharing
- `GET /api/lists/{listID}/shares` - Get all shares for a list
- `POST /api/lists/{listID}/share/{tribeID}` - Share a list with a tribe
- `DELETE /api/lists/{listID}/share/{tribeID}` - Unshare a list from a tribe

## 4. Component Implementation Details

### ListsListScreen
```jsx
// The screen will have these sections:
1. My Lists - Lists owned by the user
2. Shared Lists - Lists shared with tribes the user belongs to
3. Button to create a new list
4. Filter/search functionality for finding lists
```

### ListDetailScreen
```jsx
// Will include:
1. List details (name, description, etc.)
2. List of items in the list
3. Buttons to add/edit/delete items
4. Button to share the list
5. Button to edit list properties
6. Button to delete the list
```

### Navigation Updates
- Add a "Lists" link in the Navigation component
- Add routes for the new list components in App.js

## 5. Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic List Management

1. **Create List Service**
   - Implement listService.js with basic CRUD operations
   - Add authentication header handling

2. **Add Lists Navigation**
   - Update Navigation.js to include a Lists link
   - Add routes in App.js for list screens

3. **Implement ListsListScreen**
   - Create screen showing user's lists and shared lists
   - Add create list functionality

4. **Implement ListDetailScreen**
   - Create screen showing list details and items
   - Implement basic item management

### Phase 2: List Item Management

1. **Implement List Item CRUD**
   - Create components for adding/editing/deleting list items
   - Implement item detail view

2. **Add Support for List Types**
   - Implement different UI for different list types (location, activity, etc.)
   - Add type-specific fields and validations

### Phase 3: List Sharing

1. **Implement List Sharing**
   - Create ShareListModal component
   - Implement API integration for sharing lists

2. **Add List Share Management**
   - Create ListSharesView component
   - Implement unsharing functionality
   - Show who shared the list

### Phase 4: Advanced Features

1. **Implement List Sync Features**
   - Add Google Maps integration for location lists
   - Implement sync status indicators

2. **Add Menu Generation**
   - Implement menu generation based on lists
   - Add filtering options for menu generation

## 6. UI/UX Considerations

1. **List Card Design**
   - Show list type with appropriate icon
   - Display item count
   - Indicate shared status

2. **List Detail Layout**
   - Tabs for Items, Sharing, Settings
   - Clear visual hierarchy for list properties and actions

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Collapsible sections for small screens

## 7. Code Structure and Organization

```
frontend/
  src/
    components/
      lists/
        ListsListScreen.js
        ListDetailScreen.js
        ListItemDetailScreen.js
        CreateListModal.js
        EditListModal.js
        ListCard.js
        ListItemCard.js
        CreateListItemModal.js
        EditListItemModal.js
        ShareListModal.js
        ListSharesView.js
    services/
      listService.js
    contexts/
      ListContext.js (if needed for state management)
```

## 8. Integration with Existing Components

1. **Tribe Detail Integration**
   - Add a Lists tab in TribeDetailScreen showing lists shared with the tribe
   - Add functionality to share lists directly from TribeDetailScreen

2. **Profile Integration**
   - Add a section in ProfileScreen showing the user's lists

## 9. Roadmap and Priorities

### Immediate Tasks (MVP)
1. Create listService.js
2. Implement ListsListScreen and ListDetailScreen
3. Add basic list CRUD operations
4. Implement list sharing with tribes

### Secondary Tasks
1. Implement advanced list item management
2. Add type-specific UI and functionality
3. Implement list sync features

### Future Enhancements
1. List templates and recommendations
2. Advanced filtering and search
3. List analytics and usage tracking

## 10. Potential Backend Gaps

While developing the frontend, we may identify these potential gaps in the backend:
1. Need for more specific list filtering endpoints
2. Additional metadata fields for specialized list types
3. Bulk operations for managing multiple list items
4. Enhanced permission model for list sharing
