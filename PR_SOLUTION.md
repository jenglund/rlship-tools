# Schema Handling Fixes for Repository Tests

## Problem Summary

The test failures we experienced were related to improper handling of PostgreSQL schema paths across multiple operations. Specifically:

1. **Race conditions in schema handling**: The test infrastructure was suffering from race conditions when setting the search path and then executing queries.

2. **Schema path inconsistency**: When using `UnwrapDB`, we weren't properly maintaining the schema context, causing some tests to fail when accessing database objects.

3. **Transaction management issues**: The transaction manager properly set search paths, but in some cases, the repository code wasn't leveraging this properly.

## Root Causes

1. **Schema path race conditions**: Setting search path and then executing query as separate operations can lead to race conditions between different connections.

2. **Improper context handling**: Context cancellation was causing issues with connection management.

3. **Global state for schema tracking**: The `currentTestDBName` variable wasn't correctly synchronized with operations.

## Fixes Implemented

1. **Atomic query execution with schema path**: Modified `QueryRowContext` to combine the search path setting and query execution into a single atomic operation.

2. **Global schema tracking**: Updated `UnwrapDB` to maintain the global schema context.

3. **Debugging tools**: Added detailed logging to help track schema paths during test execution.

## Remaining Issues

The following failures still need attention:

1. **TestSetupTestDB**: Failed with context cancellation issues - need to fix context handling.

2. **TestTeardownTestDB**: Issues with active connections during teardown.

3. **TestDatabaseOperations**: Race conditions with concurrent database operations.

4. **TestTestingInfrastructure**: Issues with test data generation.

## Next Steps

1. Fix context handling in test infrastructure:
   - Use independent contexts for different operations
   - Ensure proper context propagation
   - Add proper error handling for canceled contexts

2. Improve connection management:
   - Close connections properly during teardown
   - Handle concurrent access to shared resources
   - Implement proper connection pooling for tests

3. Finalize schema handling:
   - Ensure consistency across all database methods
   - Apply the same pattern to all query types
   - Fix transaction management issues

## Implementation Strategy

The key insight is that schema paths need to be managed consistently throughout the entire codebase. Setting the search path should either:

1. Be atomic with the query execution, or
2. Be properly synchronized to prevent race conditions

Our approach addresses this by embedding the search path directly in queries where appropriate, and improving synchronization where multiple operations are needed.
