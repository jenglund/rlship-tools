# How to Fix Failing Backend Tests (Updated)

## Summary of Issues

The backend tests were failing due to several issues:

1. Global variables being used to track schema information across tests
2. Inconsistent schema management between tests
3. Bad connections due to improper connection pooling
4. Schema leakage between tests leading to table conflicts
5. Transaction management not properly tracking or respecting schemas
6. Mock implementations missing methods required by the interface

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Added missing `GetTribeListsWithContext` and `GetUserListsWithContext` methods to the mock implementation in `list_test.go`

2. ✅ Fixed database test issues:
   - Added proper schema context handling in transactions
   - Fixed metadata initialization in test fixtures to use valid JSON objects
   - Updated all repository methods to properly use schema context
   - Fixed context cancellation issues in transaction management
   - All repository and API tests now pass successfully

## Implementation Details

### Schema Management

1. Each test now creates its own isolated test schema
2. All database operations properly respect the schema context
3. Transactions maintain proper schema throughout operations

### Metadata Handling

1. Fixed metadata initialization in test fixtures
   - Updated tribe metadata to use valid JSON object: `{\"test\":\"fixture\"}`
   - Updated tribe member metadata to use valid JSON object: `{\"test\":\"member_fixture\"}`
   - Updated list metadata to use valid JSON object: `{\"test\":\"list_fixture\"}`

### Context Handling

1. Updated repository methods to use the provided schema context
   - Fixed `ShareWithTribe`, `UnshareWithTribe`, `GetListShares`, `GetSharedTribes` methods
   - Ensures proper context propagation throughout transaction operations

## Verification

All the following tests now pass successfully:
- ✅ Repository tests (postgres)
- ✅ API tests 

### Next Steps

1. Improve error handling for transaction management
2. Consider implementing connection pooling for better performance
3. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases in context handling
