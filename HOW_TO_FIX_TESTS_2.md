# How to Fix Failing Backend Tests (Updated)

## Summary of Issues

The backend tests were failing due to problems with schema isolation and database connection handling. The main issues were:

1. Global variables being used to track schema information across tests
2. Inconsistent schema management between tests
3. Bad connections due to improper connection pooling
4. Schema leakage between tests leading to table conflicts
5. Transaction management not properly tracking or respecting schemas

## Implemented Fixes

We implemented the following fixes:

1. Created a `SchemaContext` struct to replace global variables for schema management:
   - Added a new file `backend/internal/testutil/schema_context.go` with schema context handling
   - Made schema information travel with context rather than global variables

2. Enhanced DB connection handling:
   - Updated `backend/internal/testutil/db.go` with better connection pooling
   - Added proper connection cleanup to prevent "bad connection" errors

3. Improved transaction management:
   - Modified `backend/internal/repository/postgres/transaction.go` to use context-based schema info
   - Added proper error handling for transactions

4. Created context-aware repository methods:
   - Added `GetTribeListsWithContext` and `GetUserListsWithContext` methods
   - Updated existing tests to use the context-aware methods

5. Fixed schema/field mismatch issues:
   - Updated the `loadListData` method to handle schema and field mismatches more gracefully

## Fixed Tests

The following tests that were previously failing are now passing:

1. `TestListRepository_GetTribeLists`
   - Added context-aware version of the method
   - Fixed schema handling
   
2. `TestListRepository_GetUserLists`
   - Added context-aware version of the method
   - Fixed schema handling
   
3. `TestListRepository_ShareWithTribe`
   - Already working with the updated context system

## Remaining Issues

There are still some test failures in other parts of the codebase that need addressing:

1. `TestDatabaseOperations/concurrent_operations` - Failing with "relation does not exist" error
2. `TestSchemaHandling/transaction_schema_handling` - Failing with "bad connection" error
3. `TestSchemaHandling/transaction_rollback_schema_handling` - Failing with "context canceled" error
4. `TestTestingInfrastructure/Test_data_generation` - Failing with "context canceled" error

These remaining issues would need further investigation and likely similar fixes involving context-aware schema management.

## Future Work

1. Extend the context-aware approach to all repository methods
2. Improve the transaction manager to better handle concurrent operations
3. Add cleanup mechanisms to ensure schemas are properly isolated and cleaned up between tests
4. Consider using dependency injection instead of global variables for test configuration
5. Add better logging and error tracking for database operations to aid debugging
