## Implementation Details

### List Creation Validation

We have improved the list creation validation with the following enhancements:

1. Added proper whitespace trimming for both name and description
2. Implemented validation for empty or whitespace-only names
3. Added reasonable length limits for name (100 chars) and description (1000 chars)
4. Improved duplicate detection by normalizing names (trimming + case-insensitive comparison)
5. Enhanced error messages to be more descriptive and helpful
6. Added validation that users can only create lists for themselves or tribes they belong to
7. Implemented consistent validation in both handler and service layers

These improvements ensure that lists have valid, meaningful names, prevent duplicate lists with slight variations in whitespace or capitalization, and provide clear error messages to users when validation fails.

### Expired Shares Handling

We have implemented a robust solution for handling expired shares:

1. Added a new `CleanupExpiredShares` method to the `ListRepository` interface and its implementation
2. The method automatically soft-deletes any shares that have expired (based on the `expires_at` timestamp)
3. Modified the `GetSharedLists` method to clean up expired shares before returning results
4. Added comprehensive tests to verify that expired shares are properly handled
5. Added proper error handling in both repository and service layers
6. Added an admin endpoint to manually trigger cleanup of expired shares
7. Implemented a background worker that periodically cleans up expired shares

### Background Worker Implementation

The background worker for expired share cleanup has been implemented with the following features:

1. Created a `ShareCleanupWorker` that runs on a configurable interval (default: 1 hour)
2. The worker runs an initial cleanup on application startup
3. Subsequent cleanups are scheduled at the configured interval
4. Added graceful error handling to prevent worker crashes
5. Comprehensive logging to track worker activity and any errors
6. Proper integration with the application startup sequence

To test and verify the worker functionality:

1. Start the application with logging enabled
2. Observe the initial cleanup log message: "Initial share cleanup completed successfully"
3. Wait for the configured interval to see subsequent cleanup messages
4. Use the admin endpoint to trigger manual cleanup: `POST /api/v1/lists/admin/cleanup-expired-shares`
5. Verify that expired shares are properly removed by querying shared lists

### Next Steps

The list management enhancement project is now largely complete. For future improvements, we recommend:

1. **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation for all list management endpoints, including request/response formats, validation rules, and error handling guidelines.

2. **User Guide**: Develop a user guide for list management features explaining how to use the functionality and best practices.

3. **Notification System**: Implement notifications for shares that are about to expire, allowing users to renew them before they are automatically removed.

4. **Auto-Renewal Option**: Add an option for users to set up automatic renewal of expiring shares, which would extend the expiration date without requiring manual intervention.

5. **Integration Tests**: Develop end-to-end tests that verify the entire list management workflow, including creation, sharing, and expiration.

6. **Enhanced User Permissions**: Implement more granular permission control for list operations, allowing read-only access or specific editing permissions.

## API Changes

The ListService interface has been extended with a new method:

```go
// CleanupExpiredShares removes expired shares
CleanupExpiredShares() error
```

This method can be called programmatically, via the background worker, or through the admin API endpoint to clean up expired shares on demand.

## Validation Rules

- Shares with expiration dates in the past are automatically soft-deleted
- When retrieving shared lists, expired shares are automatically filtered out
- The user must have proper ownership or permissions to share/unshare a list
- List ownership is properly validated to prevent unauthorized access
- List names cannot be empty and must be within reasonable length limits
- Duplicate list detection is case-insensitive and ignores extra whitespace
