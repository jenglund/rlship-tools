## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create test files mirroring service structure**
   - Create a test file for each service file
   - Organize tests by method within each file

2. **Implement mock API layer**
   - Create a consistent approach to mocking API calls
   - Build reusable mock responses for common scenarios

3. **Follow test-driven development**
   - Write tests before implementing fixes or changes
   - Use tests to verify behavior before and after changes

4. **Prioritize testing order**
   - Start with core list management methods
   - Then test list item methods
   - Finally test sharing methods
   - Focus on happy paths first, then error conditions

5. **Maintain test coverage metrics**
   - Aim for at least 80% test coverage
   - Focus on testing complex logic paths
   - Document any intentionally uncovered code with rationale
