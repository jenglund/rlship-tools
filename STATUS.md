# Current Project Status

This document provides an overview of the current status of the Tribe project.

## Overview

ðŸŽ‰ **Green Across the Board!** ðŸŽ‰

We have successfully achieved a green status across all our GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows:
- Backend tests are passing
- Frontend tests are passing
- Linting checks are clean (with a few shadow variable warnings that we've decided to ignore)

This is a significant milestone that gives us a solid foundation to build upon. The codebase is now in a state where we can continuously iterate and add new features while maintaining stability.

## Backend Status

- **Test Coverage**: 73.4% overall, with many critical components at 80%+ coverage
- **API Functionality**: Core Tribe, List, and Activity operations are implemented
- **Database Layer**: Robust repository implementations with proper error handling

## Frontend Status

- **Mobile App**: Basic UI structure with screens for Home, Lists, Interest Buttons, and Profile. Currently attempting to run with Expo 53 and React 19.1.
- **Test Coverage**: Basic tests in place, but coverage is low (7.01%)
- **UI Components**: Using React Native Paper for consistent design
