# Current Project Status

This document provides an overview of the current status of the Tribe project.

## Overview

We have shifted our frontend development strategy from an Expo-based mobile app to a React 19-based web application. This decision was made to accelerate development and avoid compatibility issues encountered with Expo.

The backend remains stable with all tests passing.

## Backend Status

- **Test Coverage**: 73.4% overall, with many critical components at 80%+ coverage
- **API Functionality**: Core Tribe, List, and Activity operations are implemented
- **Database Layer**: Robust repository implementations with proper error handling

## Frontend Status

- **Web Application**: Initial structure created with React 19 and modern build tooling.
- **Architecture**: Component-based structure with proper separation of concerns
- **Current Phase**: Setting up the development environment and basic application structure
- **Next Steps**: Implementing authentication flow and core UI components
